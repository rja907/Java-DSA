# Java-DSA
This is a collection of codes that I did during my Java coding course.  
It covers almost all the basic topics of Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. Feel free to let me know if this helped.
This is where I had started typing structured code instead of not caring about indentation etc. 
Trust me, it really helps in the long run. Also, if you really want this to help you, try writing the code by yourself first and then look at this. That's how you will learn.
Cheers!
